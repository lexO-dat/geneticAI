# Bth1C1G1T1 growth
Growth:
- Inoculation: Inoculate individual colonies into TYG media without antibiotics and grow 18 hours overnight in the anaerobic chamber.  Dilution and Induction: Next day, dilute 100-fold into pre-reduced TYG with inducers (no antibiotics), grow for 6 hours in the anaerobic chamber.  Measurement: Plate Reader, data processing for RPUL normalization

Logic constraints:
- NOR -> 7 instances max.
- OUTPUT_OR -> unlimited

# Bth1C1G1T1 posible use
Posible Use:
- It can be used in genetic circuits as a logical switch where dCas9 blocks a promoter until it receives a signal (e.g., chemical induction), enabling combinational control in biological systems.
