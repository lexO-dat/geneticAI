Logic constraints:
- NOR -> 7 instances max.
- OUTPUT_OR -> unlimited

# Eco2C1G3T1 posible use
Posible Use:
- Intermediate, suitable for larger designs than Eco1C1G1T1 but less complex than Eco1C2G2T2.
- ideal for systems that need to evaluate specific combinations of signals (e.g., AND and OR simultaneously).
